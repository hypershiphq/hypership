## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to sign-up for Hypership at [https://hypership.dev/signup](https://hypership.dev/signup).

You can build with Hypership completely free.

Within seconds, you can have a web-app deployed with user authentication, analytics, and event tracking.

There is a handy quick-start guide after you create your first Hypership project, showing you how to pull down the codebase of your first app.

## What is Hypership?

Hypership is both a platform and a set of SDKs.

The platform is where you can manage your projects, users, events, analytics, and project settings.

The SDKs are what you use to build your app.
